Project: Diary
API: 
	[Emotion Analysis](https://rapidapi.com/twinword/api/emotion-analysis/)
Packages: 
	[Page-Flip](https://www.cssscript.com/book-page-flip-animation/)
	[Paper Css Styling (Credit to Terence Eden)](https://gitlab.com/edent/paper-prototype-css/-/tree/main)
		[Demo](https://edent.gitlab.io/paper-prototype-css/)


The purpose of this project is to allow users to type in any specific text which will be sent to this api, the response of which will be a score of the six following emotions: 
	Disgust
	Sadness
	Anger
	Joy
	Surprise
	Fear
While I would say that people should use their best judgment for determining the reception of their texts or emails, sometimes it's hard to tell why ‘Thanks.’ could be interpreted in the wrong way by whoever you send it to.
In dear_Diary, users will be able to:
	Input a diary (form data) entry, then submit it
	Receive an emotional readout from the api
	‘Turn the page’ using fancy styling behind the scenes
This is largely it, but the real work would be making sure that once you turn the page, a new form will be generated as well as the emotional readout.
